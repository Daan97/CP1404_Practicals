Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

Answers:
1. A ValueError will occur if one of the numbers is a float number
2. A ZeroDivisionError occurs when the denominator is set to 0, as you can't divide by 0.
3. No
